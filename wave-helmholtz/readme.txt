Use Elmer Grid to process each of the grid files i.e. uisng the following
 ElmerGrid 1 2 rectangle-2materials-2barrier.grd

This generates an Elmer mesh file

the scenarios have different barrier configurations to test wave propagation

Different boundary conditions have been set 
to adjust wave propagation


1. boundar y terms could be adjusted to add to source terms(at the boundary)
with a slightly diffrent frequency to give beating phenomena

2. one experiment not tried matching the driver frequency to the natural frequency 
of the system
